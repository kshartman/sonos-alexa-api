# Sonos API Implementation Summary

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Proper Group Management**
- Fixed join/leave operations to handle all legacy cases:
  - Source device already in a group (leaves first, then joins)
  - Stereo pairs (uses coordinator)
  - Detects when already in same group
- Added proper debug logging using debugManager

### 2. **Device Discovery & Topology**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Subscribe to topology events on ALL devices, not just one "preferred" device
- Initialize device map from initial topology query (creates stub devices)
- Check for service availability before subscribing
- Properly handle devices without ZoneGroupTopology service

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- All tests use event-driven patterns (no polling or fixed timeouts)
- EventManager provides:
  - `waitForState()` - waits for specific playback state
  - `waitForVolume()` - waits for volume changes
  - `waitForTopologyChange()` - waits for group changes
  - `waitForTrackChange()` - waits for track changes
- UPnP events flow: Sonos → Discovery → Server → SSE → EventBridge → Tests

### 4. **Development Environment**
- Added dotenv support (dev dependency only)
- Debug categories configured via .env file:
  - topology, upnp, discovery, api, soap
- Proper TypeScript configuration

## Test Suite Structure

### Integration Tests Created:
1. **01-infrastructure-tests.ts** - Core server/discovery tests
2. **02-playback-tests.ts** - Basic playback controls  
3. **03-volume-tests.ts** - Volume and mute controls
4. **04-content-tests.ts** - Music search and content selection
5. **05-group-tests.ts** - Group formation and management
6. **06-playback-modes-tests.ts** - Shuffle, repeat, crossfade
7. **07-advanced-tests.ts** - Sleep timer, settings, presets
8. **08-tts-tests.ts** - Text-to-speech and announcements

## Important Notes

### Portable Devices (Roam, Move)
- These devices lack some services (AVTransport, RenderingControl)
- Excluded from topology subscriptions
- Still function as group members

### Stereo Pairs
- Treated as single units
- Commands routed through coordinator
- Members don't subscribe to their own events

### Content Loading
- Many Sonos commands require content to be loaded first
- Tests must load a URI before testing play/pause/volume
- TTS temporarily interrupts playback but restores state

## Remaining Work
- Update existing playback/volume tests to load content first
- Investigate why some topology events aren't being received
- Add more comprehensive error handling tests
- Performance optimization for large Sonos systems
