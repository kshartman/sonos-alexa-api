# Spotify Integration Feature Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the legacy system's Spotify implementation to guide future integration into the modern Sonos Alexa API.

## Authentication & Authorization

### OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow
- **Required Credentials**: `clientId` and `clientSecret` must be configured in settings.json
- **Token Management**: Bearer tokens obtained from Spotify API and cached for reuse
- **Token Endpoint**: `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`
- **Grant Type**: `client_credentials` (server-to-server authentication)

### Configuration Example
```json
{
  "spotify": {
    "clientId": "your-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "your-client-secret"
  }
}
```

## Service Registration

### Sonos Service Identity
- **Service ID (SID)**: Dynamically retrieved from Sonos system (e.g., `sid=9`)
- **Service Type**: Retrieved via `player.system.getServiceType('Spotify')`
- **Service Token Format**: `SA_RINCON${serviceType}_X_#Svc${serviceType}-0-Token`
- **Account Serial Number**: Hardcoded to 14 (noted as workaround in legacy code)

## URI Construction Patterns

### Track (Song) URI
```
x-sonos-spotify:spotify%3atrack%3a{trackId}?sid={sid}&flags=8224&sn={accountSN}
```
- Flags: 8224 indicates individual track playback
- Requires URL encoding of Spotify URI

### Album URI
```
x-rincon-cpcontainer:0004206c{encodedAlbumURI}
```
- Prefix `0004206c` identifies album container
- Full Spotify album URI must be encoded

### Artist Radio URI
```
x-sonosapi-radio:spotify%3aartistRadio%3a{artistId}?sid={sid}&flags=8300&sn={accountSN}
```
- Uses different URI scheme for radio stations
- Flags: 8300 indicates radio/station playback

### Playlist URI
```
x-rincon-cpcontainer:0006206c{encodedPlaylistURI}
```
- Prefix `0006206c` identifies playlist container
- Supports both user and Spotify playlists

## Search Implementation

### API Integration
- **Base URL**: `https://api.spotify.com/v1/search`
- **Supported Types**: album, track, artist, playlist
- **Authentication**: Requires Bearer token in headers

### Search Query Construction
```javascript
// Example search patterns:
album: 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=album&limit=1&q=album:{query}'
song: 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=track&limit=50&q={query}'
station: 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=artist&limit=1&q={query}'
playlist: 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=playlist&q={query}'
```

### Advanced Search Syntax
- Supports Spotify field filters: `artist:Beatles track:Yesterday`
- Allows combining multiple search criteria
- Returns filtered results based on market availability

## Metadata Generation

### DIDL-Lite Structure
```xml
<DIDL-Lite xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 
           xmlns:upnp="urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/upnp/"
           xmlns:r="urn:schemas-rinconnetworks-com:metadata-1-0/" 
           xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/DIDL-Lite/">
  <item id="{metadataId}" parentID="{parentUri}" restricted="true">
    <dc:title>{title}</dc:title>
    <upnp:class>object.{objectType}</upnp:class>
    <desc id="cdudn" nameSpace="urn:schemas-rinconnetworks-com:metadata-1-0/">
      {serviceToken}
    </desc>
  </item>
</DIDL-Lite>
```

### Object Classes by Type
- **Track**: `object.item.audioItem.musicTrack`
- **Album**: `object.container.album.musicAlbum`
- **Station**: `object.item.audioItem.audioBroadcast.#artistRadio`
- **Playlist**: `object.container.playlistContainer`

### Metadata ID Prefixes
- **Track**: `00032020spotify%3atrack%3a`
- **Album**: `0004206cspotify%3aalbum%3a`
- **Station**: `000c206cspotify:artistRadio%3a`
- **Playlist**: `0004206cspotify%3aplaylist%3a`

## Queue Management

### Playback Actions
1. **queue**: Add to end of current queue
2. **now**: Insert after current track and play immediately
3. **next**: Insert after current track without interrupting

### Implementation Pattern
```javascript
// Play now example:
1. Set transport to queue: x-rincon-queue:{playerId}#0
2. Add URI to queue at position: currentTrackNo + 1
3. Seek to the newly added track
4. Start playback
```

## Regional Restrictions

### Market Filtering
- All content must be checked against `available_markets` array
- Only include tracks available in user's configured country
- Prevents "content not available in your region" errors

### Implementation
```javascript
// Filter tracks by market availability
if (track.available_markets == null || 
    track.available_markets.indexOf(country) != -1) {
  // Track is available, include it
}
```

## Key Implementation Considerations

### 1. Authentication Management
- Implement token refresh logic (tokens expire)
- Handle authentication failures gracefully
- Cache tokens appropriately
- Consider using refresh tokens for user-specific access

### 2. Error Handling
- Missing credentials should provide clear error message
- Handle rate limiting from Spotify API
- Gracefully handle regional restrictions
- Provide fallback for unavailable content

### 3. Duplicate Prevention
- Check for duplicate tracks when building queues
- Compare by track name (legacy method) or track ID (preferred)
- Important for artist radio and generated playlists

### 4. API Rate Limits
- Spotify Web API has rate limits
- Implement exponential backoff
- Cache search results when appropriate
- Batch API requests where possible

## Comparison with Apple Music

| Feature | Spotify | Apple Music |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Authentication | OAuth 2.0 required | No auth needed |
| Regional Restrictions | Yes, must filter | Minimal |
| URI Scheme | `x-sonos-spotify` | `x-sonos-http` |
| API Integration | Required | Optional |
| Service Token | Complex | Simple |
| Search API | Spotify Web API | iTunes Search API |

## Simplification Strategy: Public Content Only

### Rationale
To avoid the complexity of OAuth and user authentication, we could implement a simplified Spotify integration that only supports public content that doesn't require user authentication.

### Public Content Approach

#### 1. Public Playlists
- Many Spotify playlists are public and can be accessed without authentication
- Use Spotify's public embed/widget endpoints when available
- Focus on curated playlists (Spotify's own, charts, etc.)

#### 2. Artist Radio Simplification
- Use Sonos's built-in Spotify integration for artist radio
- Pass through commands rather than constructing complex URIs
- Let Sonos handle the authentication internally

#### 3. Search Simplification
- Limit search to public content only
- Use Spotify's public Web API endpoints that don't require auth
- Cache popular searches to reduce API calls

### Benefits of Simplified Approach
1. **No OAuth Required**: Eliminates token management complexity
2. **No Credentials Storage**: Improves security posture
3. **Faster Implementation**: Reduces development time significantly
4. **Better Reliability**: No token expiration issues
5. **Easier Testing**: No auth mocking required

### Limitations
- No access to user's personal playlists
- No access to user's saved tracks/albums
- Limited to publicly available content
- No personalized recommendations

### Implementation Strategy for Simplified Version

#### Phase 1: Public Playlist Support
```javascript
// Example: Play a public Spotify playlist by ID
// No authentication required if playlist is public
async function playPublicPlaylist(roomName: string, playlistId: string) {
  // Use the existing Sonos Spotify service registration
  const sid = await getSonosSpotifyServiceId();
  
  // Construct URI for public playlist
  const uri = `x-rincon-cpcontainer:0006206cspotify%3aplaylist%3a${playlistId}`;
  
  // Use existing Sonos auth rather than our own
  const metadata = generatePublicPlaylistMetadata(playlistId);
  
  return device.playUri(uri, metadata);
}
```

#### Phase 2: Leverage Existing Sonos Integration
Instead of reimplementing Spotify auth, use Sonos's existing Spotify integration:
1. Check if user has Spotify configured in Sonos
2. Use their existing service registration
3. Pass commands through rather than managing auth ourselves

### Hybrid Approach Consideration
Start with public content only, then optionally add OAuth later:
1. **v1**: Public playlists, charts, and featured content
2. **v2**: Add OAuth for users who want personal content access
3. Allow both modes to coexist

## Implementation Priority (Revised)

### Phase 1: Public Content Only
1. Detect existing Spotify service in Sonos
2. Implement public playlist playback
3. Add support for Spotify URIs/URLs
4. Create simplified metadata for public content

### Phase 2: Enhanced Public Features
1. Parse Spotify share URLs
2. Support playlist/track/album IDs from URLs
3. Add popular/chart playlists discovery
4. Implement basic search using public endpoints

### Phase 3: Full OAuth Implementation (Optional)
1. OAuth authentication flow
2. Personal playlist access
3. User's saved tracks/albums
4. Full search capabilities

## Public Content Implementation Examples

### 1. Playing Spotify Content by URL/URI
```typescript
// Support multiple input formats
async function playSpotify(room: string, input: string) {
  let spotifyId: string;
  let contentType: string;
  
  // Parse Spotify URLs: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4JAvHpjipBk
  if (input.includes('open.spotify.com')) {
    const matches = input.match(/\/(playlist|track|album)\/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/);
    if (matches) {
      contentType = matches[1];
      spotifyId = matches[2];
    }
  }
  // Parse Spotify URIs: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DX4JAvHpjipBk
  else if (input.startsWith('spotify:')) {
    const parts = input.split(':');
    contentType = parts[1];
    spotifyId = parts[2];
  }
  
  // Use existing Sonos Spotify integration
  return playSpotifyContent(room, contentType, spotifyId);
}
```

### 2. Popular Playlists Without Auth
```typescript
// Curated list of popular public playlists
const PUBLIC_PLAYLISTS = {
  'top50_global': '37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF',
  'top50_us': '37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp',
  'viral50_global': '37i9dQZEVXbLiRSasKsNU9',
  'new_releases': '37i9dQZF1DX4JAvHpjipBk',
  'chill_hits': '37i9dQZF1DX4WYpdgoIcn6',
  'workout': '37i9dQZF1DX70Ew5A6sJGh'
};

// Play by friendly name
async function playPopularPlaylist(room: string, playlistName: string) {
  const playlistId = PUBLIC_PLAYLISTS[playlistName];
  if (!playlistId) {
    throw new Error(`Unknown playlist: ${playlistName}`);
  }
  
  return playSpotifyPlaylist(room, playlistId);
}
```

### 3. Simplified Endpoints
```typescript
// GET /room/spotify/playlist/:playlistId
// GET /room/spotify/track/:trackId
// GET /room/spotify/url (with URL in body)
// GET /room/spotify/popular/:playlistName
```

## Migration Path from Legacy
