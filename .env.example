# TTS Host IP Configuration (REQUIRED for Docker)
# The IP address that Sonos devices can use to reach this server
# This is critical for TTS (text-to-speech) functionality
# 
# For Docker with host networking:
#   - Set this to your Docker host's IP address (not the container IP)
#   - Example: TTS_HOST_IP=192.168.1.100
# 
# For local development:
#   - Leave unset - the API will auto-detect your IP
#   - Or set it manually if auto-detection fails
# 
# Note: Sonos devices cannot reach 'localhost' or container-internal IPs
# TTS_HOST_IP=192.168.1.100
