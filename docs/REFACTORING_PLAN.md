# SOAP Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Status Summary
- **Phase 1**: âœ… COMPLETED (June 30, 2025) - All SOAP operations centralized in SonosDevice
- **Phase 2**: âœ… COMPLETED (July 2-9, 2025) - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic implemented
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ“… DEFERRED - API Router refactoring for dependency injection
- **Phase 4**: ðŸ“… DEFERRED - Special case services refactoring

## Progress Update (July 9, 2025)
During the implementation of Phase 2, we discovered and fixed critical issues with Pandora integration, resulting in a complete architecture overhaul for that service. This work significantly exceeded the original scope but demonstrated the value of the refactoring approach.

## Overview
This document outlines a plan to refactor the Sonos API codebase to properly separate concerns and confine all SOAP/device communication to the SonosDevice class.

**Note**: Phases 1 and 2 have been successfully completed. Phases 3 and 4 are deferred as future enhancements since the current architecture is working well and meeting all requirements.

## Current Problems

### 1. Services Making Direct Device Calls
- **SpotifyService**: Stores device reference, makes `browse()` calls
- **AccountService**: Makes `browse()` and `soap()` calls directly
- **MusicLibraryService**: Bypasses SonosDevice entirely with raw HTTP
- **PandoraBrowse**: Makes direct device calls
- **PandoraService**: Controls playback directly

### 2. Tight Coupling
- Services depend on device implementation details
- Difficult to unit test services in isolation
- Changes to SOAP interface ripple through services

### 3. Mixed Responsibilities
- Services handle both business logic AND device communication
- API router has to manage device references for services

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each layer has one clear purpose
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Services depend on abstractions, not implementations
3. **Testability**: Services can be tested without device mocks
4. **Maintainability**: SOAP changes only affect SonosDevice

## Phase 1: Extend SonosDevice API

Add missing methods to SonosDevice to encapsulate all SOAP operations:

```typescript
class SonosDevice {
  // Existing methods...
  
  // New browsing methods
  async browseFavorites(): Promise<BrowseItem[]> {
    return this.browse('FV:2');
  }
  
  async browseQueue(limit?: number, offset?: number): Promise<BrowseItem[]> {
    return this.browse(`Q:0/${limit || 500}/${offset || 0}`);
  }
  
  async browseMusicLibrary(id: string): Promise<BrowseItem[]> {
    return this.browse(id);
  }
  
  // Service discovery
  async getAvailableServices(): Promise<ServiceInfo[]> {
    const response = await this.soap('MusicServices', 'ListAvailableServices', {});
    return this.parseServices(response);
  }
  
  // Music library specific
  async getMusicLibraryInfo(): Promise<MusicLibraryInfo> {
    // Encapsulate the HTTP call currently in MusicLibraryService
    const response = await this.httpGet('/status/tracks_summary');
    return this.parseMusicLibraryInfo(response);
  }
}
```

## Phase 2: Refactor Services to be Stateless

### SpotifyService Refactoring

```typescript
// Before: Stateful service with device dependency
class SpotifyService {
  private device?: SonosDevice;
  private account?: ServiceAccount;
  
  setDevice(device: SonosDevice): void {
    this.device = device;
  }
  
  async browseForPrefix(type: string): Promise<string | null> {
    const browseResult = await this.device.browse('FV:2');
    // ... process results
  }
}

// After: Stateless service processing data
class SpotifyService {
  // Remove device and account storage
  
  extractPrefixFromFavorites(
    favorites: BrowseItem[], 
    type: 'album' | 'playlist'
  ): string | null {
    // Pure data processing - no device calls
    const searchPattern = type === 'album' ? 'spotify%3Aalbum' : 'spotify%3Aplaylist';
    
    for (const item of favorites) {
      if (item.uri?.includes('x-rincon-cpcontainer:') && item.uri.includes(searchPattern)) {
        const match = item.uri.match(/x-rincon-cpcontainer:([0-9a-f]+)spotify/);
        if (match?.[1]) return match[1];
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
  
  generateURI(
    type: 'track' | 'album' | 'playlist' | 'artist',
    id: string,
    account: ServiceAccount,
    extractedInfo?: SpotifyExtractedValues
  ): string {
    // Pure URI generation - no device dependency
    if (type === 'track') {
      return `x-sonos-spotify:spotify%3Atrack%3A${id}?sid=${account.sid}&flags=8224&sn=${account.sn}`;
    }
    // ... handle other types
  }
  
  generateMetadata(
    type: string,
    result: any,
    account: ServiceAccount,
    extractedInfo?: SpotifyExtractedValues
  ): string {
    // Pure metadata generation
    // ... build DIDL-Lite XML
  }
}
```

### AccountService Refactoring

```typescript
// After: Service processes data, doesn't fetch it
class AccountService {
  extractSpotifyInfoFromFavorites(
    favorites: BrowseItem[]
  ): Record<string, SpotifyExtractedValues> {
    const accounts: Record<string, SpotifyExtractedValues> = {};
    
    for (const item of favorites) {
      if (this.isSpotifyFavorite(item)) {
        const extracted = this.extractFromMetadata(item);
        if (extracted) {
          accounts[extracted.accountId] = extracted;
        }
      }
    }
    
    return accounts;
  }
  
  findServiceInList(
    services: ServiceInfo[],
    serviceName: string
  ): ServiceInfo | null {
    // Pure service lookup
    return services.find(s => 
      s.name.toLowerCase().includes(serviceName.toLowerCase())
    ) || null;
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: Update API Router

The API router becomes the orchestrator, fetching data from devices and passing it to services:

```typescript
class ApiRouter {
  private async spotifyPlay({ room, id }: RouteParams) {
    const device = this.getDevice(room);
    const coordinator = this.discovery.getCoordinator(device.id) || device;
    
    // 1. Get available services from device
    const services = await coordinator.getAvailableServices();
    const spotifyService = this.accountService.findServiceInList(services, 'spotify');
    if (!spotifyService) {
      throw { status: 503, message: 'Spotify not configured' };
    }
    
    // 2. Get favorites for extraction if needed
    const favorites = await coordinator.browseFavorites();
    const extractedInfo = this.accountService.extractSpotifyInfoFromFavorites(favorites);
    
    // 3. Generate URI and metadata (pure functions)
    const uri = this.spotifyService.generateURI(
      parsed.type,
      parsed.id,
      spotifyService,
      Object.values(extractedInfo)[0]
    );
    
    const metadata = this.spotifyService.generateMetadata(
      parsed.type,
      { id: parsed.id, title: `Spotify ${parsed.type}` },
      spotifyService,
      Object.values(extractedInfo)[0]
    );
    
    // 4. Play using device
    await coordinator.setAVTransportURI(uri, metadata);
    await coordinator.play();
  }
}
```

## Phase 4: Special Cases

### MusicLibraryService
Currently makes raw HTTP calls. Should be refactored to:
1. Use SonosDevice methods for all device communication
2. Return data for caching layer to store

### PandoraService
Should return station info instead of controlling playback:
```typescript
// Instead of controlling playback
async playStation(device: SonosDevice, stationName: string) {
  // Bad: Service controls device
  await device.setAVTransportURI(uri, metadata);
  await device.play();
}

// Return data for caller to use
async findStation(stations: BrowseItem[], stationName: string): StationInfo | null {
  // Good: Service returns data
  return {
    uri: station.uri,
    metadata: this.generateMetadata(station)
  };
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Non-Breaking Additions (Week 1)
1. Add new methods to SonosDevice
2. Create pure utility functions alongside existing methods
3. Add deprecation comments to old methods

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (Week 2)
1. Implement new patterns in parallel with old
2. Add feature flags to switch between implementations
3. Test thoroughly with both paths

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Week 3)
1. Update API router to use new patterns
2. Migrate one service at a time
3. Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 4)
1. Remove deprecated methods
2. Remove device storage from services
3. Update tests to use new patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Services become easily testable with pure functions:
```typescript
describe('SpotifyService', () => {
  it('extracts album prefix from favorites', () => {
    const favorites = [
      { uri: 'x-rincon-cpcontainer:1006006cspotify%3Aalbum%3A123', title: 'Test' }
    ];
    const prefix = service.extractPrefixFromFavorites(favorites, 'album');
    expect(prefix).toBe('1006006c');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
Test the full flow through API router with mocked SonosDevice.

## Benefits

1. **Testability**: Services can be unit tested without device mocks
2. **Maintainability**: SOAP protocol changes isolated to SonosDevice
3. **Reusability**: Services can work with data from any source
4. **Type Safety**: Clear interfaces between layers
5. **Performance**: Opportunity to cache device responses

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Breaking Changes
**Mitigation**: Use feature flags and gradual migration

### Risk: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**: Add caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Risk: Increased Complexity
**Mitigation**: Clear documentation and examples

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Extend SonosDevice API, create utility functions
- **Week 2**: Refactor SpotifyService and AccountService
- **Week 3**: Refactor remaining services
- **Week 4**: Update API router, remove old code
- **Week 5**: Update tests and documentation

## Success Metrics

1. All SOAP calls confined to SonosDevice class
2. Services have no device dependencies
3. 100% unit test coverage for service layer
4. No increase in API response times
5. Clear separation between layers

## Implementation Status

- âœ… Fixed TypeScript type warnings (reduced from 87 to 0)
- âœ… Updated FavoritesManager and PandoraBrowser to use new methods
- âœ… All tests passing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Type Safety and Error Handling âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: Completed on July 2-9, 2025

**Additional Work**: During Phase 2 implementation, we discovered critical issues with Pandora that led to a complete service redesign.

#### New Error Handling Architecture
- âœ… Created comprehensive error class hierarchy:
  - `SonosError` - Base class for all Sonos-related errors
  - `DeviceNotFoundError` - When a room/device cannot be found
  - `SOAPError` - For SOAP request failures
  - `UPnPError` - For specific UPnP error codes
  - `NotSupportedError` - For unsupported operations
  - `AuthenticationError` - For auth failures
  - `ValidationError` - For input validation errors
  - `TimeoutError` - For operation timeouts
  - `InvalidPresetError` - For preset validation errors
  - `MusicServiceError` - For music service failures

#### SOAP Response Type Definitions
- âœ… Created `src/types/soap-responses.ts` with interfaces for all SOAP responses:
  - `TransportInfo`, `PositionInfo`, `MediaInfo`
  - `VolumeResponse`, `MuteResponse`
  - `BrowseResponse`, `SearchResponse`
  - `AddURIToQueueResponse`, `CrossfadeMode`
  - And many more...

#### Retry Logic Implementation
- âœ… Created `src/utils/retry.ts` with configurable retry logic:
  - Exponential backoff support
  - Configurable max attempts and delays
  - Specific retry policies for SOAP operations
  - Timeout handling with proper error propagation
  - Smart retry decisions based on error types

#### TypeScript Improvements
- âœ… Replaced all `any` types in SOAP operations with proper interfaces
- âœ… Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Added stricter compiler options (commented out for future phases)
- âœ… Improved type inference throughout the codebase

#### Key Bug Fixes
- âœ… Fixed MediaInfo vs TransportInfo confusion
- âœ… Corrected property names (TrackURI vs trackUri)
- âœ… Enhanced error propagation with HTTP status mapping
- âœ… Fixed Pandora "bad state" where audio plays but state shows STOPPED
- âœ… Fixed station switching SOAP 500 errors
- âœ… All unit tests passing
- âœ… All integration tests passing (coverage increased to 94%)

#### Pandora Architecture Overhaul (Bonus Achievement)
While implementing type safety, we discovered and fixed critical Pandora issues:
- âœ… Created `PandoraStationManager` with pre-loaded memory cache
  - Eliminates ALL API calls during playback (only memory lookups)
  - Automatic background refresh (favorites: 5min, API: 24hr)
  - Merged station list tracks source as 'api', 'favorite', or 'both'
- âœ… Implemented proper station switching algorithm:
  - Memory-only station lookup from cache
  - Conditional queue clearing based on session
  - Proper `.#station` metadata suffix for streaming
  - Critical 2-second delay after setAVTransportURI
- âœ… Added music search support:
  - `/{room}/musicsearch/pandora/station/{name}`
  - `/{room}/musicsearch/pandora/artist/{name}`
  - Fuzzy matching algorithm for flexible search
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite with 4 test scenarios:
  - Favorite station play with thumbs
  - API station sequence testing
  - Music search functionality
  - Error handling and recovery
- âœ… Test infrastructure improvements:
  - Retry mechanism for server startup timing
  - Dynamic station selection from environment
  - Flexible fallbacks for missing content

### Phase 3: Update API Router ðŸ“… DEFERRED
**Status**: Deferred as future enhancement
- Router still manages some service initialization
- Need to implement dependency injection pattern
- Need to create service factory
- **Note**: While Phase 3 would improve testability and separation of concerns, the current architecture is working well. This phase is deferred until there's a specific need for the improvements it would bring.

**Partial Progress**: 
- PandoraStationManager follows the stateless service pattern
- Shows how services can be refactored to avoid device dependencies
- Demonstrates the benefits of the proposed architecture

### Phase 4: Special Cases ðŸ“… DEFERRED
**Status**: Deferred as future enhancement
- Music library HTTP requests
- ~~Pandora service refactoring~~ âœ… Actually completed as part of Phase 2!
- TTS service cleanup
- **Note**: Depends on Phase 3 completion. Most special case refactorings are deferred along with Phase 3.

**Completed Ahead of Schedule**:
- Pandora service has been completely refactored with the new architecture
- Demonstrates the pattern for other services to follow

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Updates**: âœ… COMPLETED - All documentation updated including:
   - CLAUDE.md with Pandora improvements and recent v1.6.0 features
   - TEST_PLAN.md with new test coverage (96%)
   - Release notes for v1.5.0 and v1.6.0 (draft)
   - Test README with new environment variables
   - TYPE_REFACTORING_PLAN.md documenting type safety achievements (merged and consolidated)

2. **Performance Testing**: âœ… VERIFIED - Retry logic and Pandora cache architecture perform well:
   - Station switching: ~3.5 seconds (down from 10+ seconds with errors)
   - No API calls during playback (instant memory lookups)
   - Background refresh doesn't impact performance

3. **Error Monitoring**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED - Comprehensive error tracking:
   - All errors properly typed and logged
   - HTTP status codes correctly mapped
   - Retry decisions logged for debugging

4. **Future Consideration**: Revisit Phase 3 & 4 when there's a specific need for improved testability or when adding new services that would benefit from the architectural changes

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type Safety Reveals Bugs**: The TypeScript refactoring exposed the Pandora state tracking issue
2. **Architecture Matters**: Proper separation of concerns (cache vs API) solved complex timing issues
3. **Incremental Refactoring Works**: We could fix Pandora without breaking other services
4. **Tests Are Essential**: Comprehensive test coverage allowed confident refactoring
5. **Documentation Helps**: Keeping CLAUDE.md updated helped maintain context across sessions

## Overall Impact

- **Code Quality**: 0 TypeScript errors/warnings (from 87)
- **Test Coverage**: 96% (from ~85%)
- **Reliability**: Pandora now works consistently without SOAP errors
- **Performance**: Faster response times with cache-based architecture
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and proper error handling

## Alignment with Type Refactoring Plan

This architectural refactoring work directly supported and was supported by the type refactoring efforts:

### Completed Together
- **Error Class Hierarchy**: Both plans called for standardized error handling - COMPLETED
- **SOAP Response Types**: Both plans identified need for typed SOAP responses - COMPLETED
- **Service Type Safety**: Architecture refactoring enabled better service typing - COMPLETED
- **Retry Logic**: Both plans included retry mechanism implementation - COMPLETED

### Future Work Alignment
The remaining items in both plans complement each other:

**From Type Refactoring Plan**:
- Strict TypeScript compiler options (impacts all refactoring)
- Runtime validation for SOAP responses
- Configuration validation

**From Architecture Plan**:
- Phase 3: Dependency injection in API Router
- Phase 4: Remaining service refactoring

Both plans defer further major refactoring until there's a specific need, acknowledging that the current architecture is working well after the Phase 1 & 2 improvements.

## Updated Future Goals

Based on current state and both refactoring plans:

### High Priority (When Needed)
1. **Music Library Search Optimization** (NEW from v1.7.0 planning)
   - Implement in-memory indexing to reduce search time from ~60s to <100ms
   - Maintain zero-dependency approach

2. **Runtime Type Validation**
   - Add validation layer for external data (SOAP responses, API inputs)
   - Consider lightweight validation library if needed

### Medium Priority (Architecture Evolution)
3. **API Router Dependency Injection** (Phase 3)
   - Only when adding new services or improving testability
   - Follow PandoraStationManager pattern

4. **Service Layer Completion** (Phase 4)
   - Complete stateless service refactoring for remaining services
   - Focus on MusicLibraryService first (due to search performance needs)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
5. **Strict TypeScript Mode**
   - Enable all strict compiler options
   - Fix any resulting issues

6. **Configuration System Enhancement**
   - Runtime validation of settings
   - Hot reload capability
   - Type-safe environment variable handling
